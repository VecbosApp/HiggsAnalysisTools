# README file for HiggsAnalysisTools

How to compile and run
----------------------
> cd HiggsAnalysisTools
> make all

if you modify the file HiggsSelection.{cc,hh}) you have to
clean to recompile:
> make clean ; make all

prepare a text file (ex. "file.txt") with the full-path names of the ROOT files to chain:
> cat file.txt
/castor/cern.ch/user/c/crovelli/HWW_2007/qqH160_noEleID_bugFixed/qqH160-1.root
/castor/cern.ch/user/c/crovelli/HWW_2007/qqH160_noEleID_bugFixed/qqH160-10.root
[...]

> ./HiggsApp list.txt

wait for the output (for the moment only a table with efficiencies)



How to configure the selection
------------------------------
There are two configuration files.

* 2e2nuCuts.txt
* 2e2nuSwitches.txt

*** in 2e2nuCuts.txt are specified the cuts to apply, with the syntax:
	varA	min	max
if one of the variables that selection expects (see "addCut"s in the code HiggsSelection.cc)
is missing, the cut is not applied (aka "switched OFF")

*** in 2e2nuSwitches.txt are specified which of the cuts expected are ON or OFF. Syntax is:
	varA	1  
	varB	0
varA cut is ON and varB cut is OFF.
If one switch is missing, then the cut is OFF.
Note that it is expected one switch per cut, but more switches than cuts can be present.
(example: "jetVeto", which do not correspond to an interval to cut, then it is not in 2e2nuCuts.txt)


Applications: *Higgs* and *ElectronID*
--------------------------------------
One can choose to apply the full Higgs Selection, or
a reduced selection with only the Electron ID standalone.
The last one will be definitively put in the electron producer in CMSSW,
but for studies purposes it is reproduced here.
To switch to ElectronID one has to put 
#define 2
in Applications.hh, recompile and run.

Enjoy....
