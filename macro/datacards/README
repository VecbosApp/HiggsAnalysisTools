# produce the yields txt files. vgamma are separate for historical reasons
# they are pure MC estimates + data counts. 
# backgrounds estimated from data will be substituted by assembleCards.py

# from macro/ directory use HiggsYields.cc that produces:
# mcyields.txt
# vgamma-yields-mc.txt 

mv mcyields.txt vgamma-yields-mc.txt datacards
cd datacards

# copy all the input cards

# do the 0-j and 1-jet cards from data-estimation and yields
