--- combine the parametric MR datacards with SF cut based and VBF cut based ---
1. make the 1D combined datacards:
./scripts/combcards.sh -p datacards

2. make the 2D (for OF 0/1 jet) datacards
./scripts/combcards.sh -p datacards -t

--- run the limits ---
./scripts/runLimits.py -p test0 -l 12.1 comb_0j1j

- make limit tables, then plots -
./scripts/makeLimitTable.py comb_0j1j
./scripts/plotPlots.py -p test0 -l 12.1 -t comb_0j1j comb_0j1j (add -o to draw the observed)



--- run the significance ---
1. Expected:
./scripts/runLimits.py -S -p test0 -l 12.1 comb_0j1j

2. Observed:
./scripts/runLimits.py -S -o -p test0 -l 12.1 comb_0j1j

- make significance plot -
./scripts/makeSignificanceTable.py comb_0j1j 
./scripts/plotPlots.py -S -p test0 -l 12.1 -t comb_0j1j comb_0j1j (add -o to draw the observed)
